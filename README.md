This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving an infinite loop within a `useEffect` hook. The issue arises from an incorrect conditional statement that always leads to the `setCount` function being called, resulting in a continuous update cycle.  The solution involves correcting the conditional logic to ensure the effect only runs under specific conditions, thus preventing the infinite loop.
